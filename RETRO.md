  <h1>DemoQATesting Retrospective</h1>

<h2>🎯 Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of this project was to test the website's functionality and quality using QA methods.</p>

<h2>✅ What Went Well</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Test scenarios were well-defined and covered key functionalities</li>
  <li>Automation scripts ran smoothly with no bugs</li>
  <li>Documentation was clear and up to date</li>
</ul>

<h2>❌ What Didn’t Go Well</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Locating elements with Selenium was challenging due to missing unique IDs; had to rely on class names or other attributes.</li>
  <li>Testing on the live version required a steady internet connection, which occasionally affected test stability compared to a local environment.</li>
</ul>


<h2>🔧 What to Improve</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Expand the number of test cases to achieve broader coverage.</li>
  <li>Include more edge cases and negative scenario testing.</li>
  <li>Add support for testing on multiple browsers (e.g., Firefox, Edge, Safari).</li>
</ul>
